# 欢迎来到我的个人垃圾桶。

Hi, welcome to the room of my own, aka __nuova stanza__, inspired by the one and only Miss Virginia Woolf.

Something about myself:
- Constantly struggling with writing because being *bilingual* means *you lose two languages*
- Abhor anything I write the split second I finish, so there's no beta reading
- Live on self-criticism
- They say the kind of music you listen to at 12 will stay with you forever. It's true. Mine are VOCALOID and Rock.
- My panacea to anxiety and stress is my Fender Strat🎸

天性狷介，自恃甚高。

人生目标是做个思想家和一个善良的人。

短期目标是多看多写、少自怨自艾。



Thanks for reading this. I am very unapologetic for wasting a good 3 minutes of your life since I obviously wasted more time creating this site.
