# 欢迎来到我的个人垃圾桶。
~~Even a trash can needs a designer, right?~~


Hi, welcome to the room of my own, aka __nuova stanza__, inspired by the famous essay written by the one and only Miss Virginia Woolf.



Something about myself:
- Math major graduate but born with a heart for literature and films.
- Constantly struggling with writing because being *bilingual* means *you lose two languages*
  - have different personalities in different languages
- I'm going through that stage in my life which I abhor anything I write the split second I finish, so no beta reading
- Love to take criticisms❤
- They say the kind of music you listen to at 12 will stay with you forever. It's true and in my case it's VOCALOID and rock.
- My panacea to anxiety and stress is my Fender Strat🎸



好高骛远、狂妄不羁。

人生目标是做个思想家。

短期目标是多看多写、少自怨自艾。



Thanks for reading this. I am very unapologetic for wasting a good 3 minutes of your life since I obviously wasted more creating this site.
